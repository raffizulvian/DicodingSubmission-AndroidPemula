# DicodingSubmission-AndroidPemula
This repo contains my project to complete the Dicoding submission task for "Kelas Membuat Aplikasi Android Pemula". This android app will show some information about several of Indonesia`s universities.

In this app, I implement my knowledge about RecyclerView, activity moving, creating a menu, and transferring data through activity.

All of the information provided in this app is gathered from Wikipedia. The usage of any information and university logos in this app is for educational purposes only.
